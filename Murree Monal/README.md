# Murree - Monal
### Ai Spline 
Made by srinoob#8671

#### Features
Covers the Murree loop and the highway from pits to the gas station and roundabout at the base of Murree loop.
Does not cover the drag strip roads, the roads leading up to the enormous ramps and also doesn't cover the Monal hill climb and fantasy descent road. Monal loop has very sharp corners and I'm not sure the AI would react well to those. I will cover them if requested though.
Traffic covers all 4 lanes on the 4 lane parts.
